# Quantum Key Distribution – BB84 Protocol

## Problem Statement
In the digital age, cybersecurity has become a critical concern, especially with the rapid advancement of quantum computing. Traditional cryptographic methods, such as RSA and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), which rely on the computational hardness of problems like factoring large numbers and discrete logarithms, are at risk of being broken by the computational power of quantum computers. This vulnerability poses a serious threat to the security of sensitive data in sectors such as finance, healthcare, and government.

One of the primary threats from quantum computing to current cryptographic systems is its ability to solve these problems in polynomial time using algorithms like Shor’s Algorithm, rendering classical encryption techniques obsolete. As quantum technology continues to evolve, there is an urgent need to develop quantum-resistant cryptographic solutions.

One promising solution to this problem is Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), a cryptographic method that uses quantum mechanics to securely exchange keys between parties. QKD leverages the unique properties of quantum states to ensure that any attempt at eavesdropping on the communication channel introduces detectable errors, which enables the communicating parties to detect and prevent interception. Among the most well-known QKD protocols is the BB84 protocol.

Despite its theoretical security, QKD has practical challenges when it comes to implementing and understanding how it operates, particularly in the presence of an eavesdropper (Eve) who attempts to intercept the communication. As quantum technology becomes increasingly accessible, there is a growing demand to not only understand the theoretical underpinnings of QKD but also to simulate and visualize these concepts in a way that is understandable and applicable to real-world encryption problems.

## Project Objective
This project aims to build an interactive Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) simulation that demonstrates how two parties (Alice and Bob) can securely share a key using quantum mechanics (BB84 protocol), detect eavesdropping, and use the final key to encrypt a message.

This simulation demonstrates:
- How quantum mechanics prevents eavesdropping (Eve can't copy qubits without disturbing them).
- What happens when Eve attempts to intercept.
- How Alice and Bob can detect intrusion and ensure secure encryption.

### Simulate the BB84 Protocol:

- Implement the BB84 key exchange protocol to demonstrate how Alice (the sender) and Bob (the receiver) exchange secure keys using quantum bits (qubits).
- Use quantum gates like Hadamard, Pauli-X, and Pauli-Z to encode, transmit, and measure the qubits based on randomly chosen bases.
- Compare the keys generated by Alice and Bob to determine how many bits match, representing the secure shared key.

### Simulate Eavesdropping:

- Simulate the presence of an eavesdropper (Eve) who intercepts and attempts to measure the qubits during transmission.
- Use quantum measurement principles to show how Eve’s measurement introduces errors in the communication, which can be detected by Alice and Bob.
- Calculate the error rate and determine whether the key exchange was successful or if the communication was compromised.

### Real-world Encryption Application:

- Extend the simulation by demonstrating how the secure key generated through BB84 can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages.
- Provide a practical example where Alice and Bob securely communicate using the shared key, showcasing the relevance of QKD in real-world applications.

### Visualization and Analysis:

- Create visual representations of the QKD process, including key generation, comparison, and error detection.
- Provide an interactive Streamlit app that allows users to simulate the protocol and visualize the process of secure key generation and eavesdropping.
